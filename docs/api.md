# Enabling/Setting up API Access

Numerous allows you to expose your apps functionality not just through a web UI, but also as an API. API capability is useful when your users want to include your appâ€™s functionality in their own scripts and applications.

If you would like to enable your users to have access to your app via API requests, follow these steps:

1\. Manually update the TOML file and add the following lines:

```
# numerous.toml

# existing manifest content ...

[api]
  enabled = true
```

If you would like to include API docs for your app, you can include a docs path similar to this (where `/docs` needs to be changed to the actual docs route):

```
# numerous.toml

# existing manifest content ...

[api]
  enabled = true
  docs_path = "/docs"

```

2\. Deploy the app using the `numerous deploy` command
<br/>3\. The backend will update the app "state" and will enable the API access.
<br/>4\. Once you have enabled API access, users can find the API docs and option to create API keys on the app card. Find more information about API Keys on the [platform documentation page](https://www.numerous.com/docs).
